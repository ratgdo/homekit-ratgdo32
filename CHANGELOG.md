# Change Log

**v3.x.x firmware is for ratgdo32 and ratgdo32-disco boards only**

All notable changes to `homekit-ratgdo32` will be documented in this file. This project tries to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## v3.3.8 (2025-10-19)

### What's Changed

* Bugfix: dry contact doors not reporting status correctly on web page. https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo32/issues/109
* Bugfix: Sec+1.0 add timeout when waiting for GDO reply to poll commands https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo32/issues/111
* Other: Save door open/close durations so not reset to unknown on a reboot
* Other: Add timers to check that door starts to open/close and reaches fully opened/closed state in expected time
* Other: Sec+2.0 use MotorOn packet to error correct if we miss notification packet of door opening or closing
* Other: Add serial CLI commands to scan WiFi networks and reset door ID & rolling codes
* Other: Remove known issues list from prior versions in CHANGELOG.md... because they are now repeating

### Known Issues

* Sec+ 1.0 doors with digital wall panel (e.g. 889LM) sometimes do not close after a time-to-close delay. Please watch your door to make sure it closes after TTC delay.
* Sec+ 1.0 doors with "0x37" digital wall panel (e.g. 398LM) not working.  We now detect but will not support them.  Recommend replacing with 889LM panel.
* When creating automations in Apple Home the garage door may show only lock/unlock and not open/close as triggers.  This is a bug in Apple Home. Workaround is to use the Eve App to create the automation, it will show both options.
* ESP8266 (original ratgdo) only... possible crash when a storm of HomeKit messages arrives... which may be triggered on a upgrade to Apple iOS 26 / tvOS 26 / etc.  System recovers.

## v3.3.1 (2025-09-13)

### What's Changed

* Bugfix... Updating from GitHub was not finding the firmware download file.

## v3.3.0 (2025-09-13)

Version 3.3.0 is a significant upgrade for ESP32-based ratgdo boards. Almost all source files for the ESP8266 and ESP32 versions of ratgdo have been merged which results in minor changes to the underlying features and function for ESP32 versions. The main benefit is for the original ESP8266-based ratgdo boards.

While source files have been merged there remain significant differences between the two board types, most notably in the library used to communicate with HomeKit which are completely different.

* Before an Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrade it is good to first reboot your current version.

### What's Changed

* Other... Significant source code changes to support move towards single code base for ESP8266 and ESP32
* Other... Change garage door communications from using GDOLIB library to same code as used for ESP8266

## v3.1.5 (2025-03-31)

Version 3.1.x include major change to garage door opener (GDO) communications.  This has major benefit in separating out the details of communicating with the garage door from HomeKit and the ratgdo user interface, greatly simplifying our code.

### What's Changed

* Bugfix: Dry contact wall panel button not working, fixes issue #57

### Known Issues

* Still testing... Future updates MAY include breaking changes requiring a flash erase and re-upload.

## v3.1.4 (2025-03-30)

Version 3.1.x include major change to garage door opener (GDO) communications.  This has major benefit in separating out the details of communicating with the garage door from HomeKit and the ratgdo user interface, greatly simplifying our code.

### What's Changed

* Feature: Allow selection between software serial port emulation and hardware UART.  May help with issue #48
* Feature: Add debug terminal command to print out buffered message log
* Bugfix: Default to always use ratgdo's own timer for door time-to-close (TTC) and not the TTC built-in to garage door opener.  Partially fixes issue #50
* Bugfix: Remove user interface setting for built-in time-to-close, also addresses issue #50
* Bugfix: Garage door opening/closing status not reported correctly to HomeKit, fixes issue #53
* Buffix: Sec+ 1.0 garage door was unexpectedly opening on reboot when switching between hardware UART and s/w serial
* Other: Add additional debug and error checking to assist with fixing issue #51

### Known Issues

* Still testing... Future updates MAY include breaking changes requiring a flash erase and re-upload.

## v3.1.0 - v3.1.3 (2025-03-07)

Version 3.1.x include major change to garage door opener (GDO) communications.  This has major benefit in separating out the details of communicating with the garage door from HomeKit and the ratgdo user interface, greatly simplifying our code.

As this is a major change, thorough testing is required.

### What's Changed

* Feature: Updated [HomeSpan](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan) to version 2.1.1
* Feature: Use new [library](https://github.com/dkerr64/gdolib) for garage door communications
* Feature: For Sec+2.0 use GDO's built-in Time-to-Close (TTC).  Option on user interface to disable and use ratgdo timer.
* Feature: Add user option to disable HomeKit motion and occupancy accessories for vehicle presence.
* Feature: Add door opening and closing duration to web page (calculated first time door operated after reboot).
* Feature: Added message log level to user interface, defaults to INFO.
* Bugfix: Dry contact should be working now, fixes issue #41
* Other: Replace all our RINFO()/RERROR() message log macros with standard ESP_LOGx() macros.

Note: The built-in TTC feature operates slightly differently than ratgdo's timer.  If you set the TTC to e.g. 20 seconds, then on requesting a door close it will wait, in silence, for 20 seconds then sound its internal beeper and flash the lights for 10 seconds before closing the door... thus 30 seconds before the door closes.  The TTC timer in ratgdo will immediately sound its buzzer and flash lights, and close the door after 20 seconds.

### Known Issues

* Still testing... Future updates MAY include breaking changes requiring a flash erase and re-upload.
